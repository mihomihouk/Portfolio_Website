## Overview

This is my portfolio website developed using Next.js, TypeScript, Contentful, and Chakra UI. To showcase my previous projects and biography, I added dynamic animations using Framer Motion and smooth scrolling with React-scroll. The site also features a public-facing analytics dashboard — typically hidden in admin areas, but left accessible here to demonstrate full-stack capabilities.
